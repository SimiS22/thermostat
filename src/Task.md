# Task

We're going to write a high end international thermostat.

1. We need an `<input>` field that you can use to enter any number of degrees celcius
2. For fine adjustments, provide two buttons; each raising/lowering the temperature by 1
3. Since we're international, we should provide another `<input>` which can be used to enter degrees Fahrenheit.
4. a) the Fahrenheit input behaves as the celcius input
4. b) when entering a number in either field the other gets calculated respectively
5. For convenience we will provide 3 preset buttons, setting the temperatures to
5. a) the freezing point
5. b) the body temperature
5. c) the boiling point
